  // Question 1: Fallen Asleep During Lecture
  ["Been there, done that. Those lectures can be snoozy!", "Wow, you have amazing focus! I'm always tempted to catch some Zzzs in class."],
  // Question 2: Pretended to be Sick
  ["Guilty as charged! Sometimes you just need a mental health day.", "You're a trooper! Pushing through even when you don't feel well is admirable."],
  // Question 3: Sent Wrong Text Message
  ["Oh no, the struggle is real! Who was the unlucky recipient?", "You're lucky! I've definitely sent a few embarrassing texts in my day."],
  // Question 4: Broken a Bone
  ["Ouch! That sounds painful. How'd it happen?", "Lucky duck!"],
  // Question 5: Dyed Hair Unconventional Color
  ["Whoa, that sounds bold! What color did you choose?", "Natural hair is beautiful too. But hey, if you're happy, that's all that matters."],
  // Question 6: Talked in My Sleep
  ["Haha, that's classic! Do you remember what you said?", "Sweet dreams! I can barely remember my dreams, let alone talk in them."],
  // Question 7: Eaten Something I Regretted
  ["We've all been there! What was the culprit?", "You have great self-control! I sometimes indulge in a little too much dessert."],
  // Question 8: Sung Karaoke in Public
  ["Belting out those tunes, I love it! What's your go-to karaoke song?", "Maybe next time! Karaoke can be a lot of fun, even if you're not a pro."],
  // Question 9: Been on a Blind Date
  ["Sounds exciting! How did it go?", "Sticking to familiar territory is cool too. There's something to be said about comfort."],
  // Question 10: Wished to be Invisible
  ["We all have our moments! What would you do if you were invisible?", "Being seen can be a good thing! But sometimes you just want to blend in."],
